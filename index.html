			<p>My Name is Chloe King. I am 18 years old. I currently live in Orlando. I have always been interested in technology. From a young age I started using our family computer and I always pondered about how web pages are created. As I got older, my love for technology blossomed when I found out about video games. My first console was a Wii, I moved onto an Xbox 360, and so forth as new consoles are being developed often. Before finishing high school with my associates degree, I began to research what kind of career I could eventually acquire in technology. Web development sparked my interest and led me to where I am today. I know that this may be a difficult journey to eventually make my dream a reality; however, I know I will not give up because I am a hard worker who enjoys challenges and will do everything in my power to succeed.
